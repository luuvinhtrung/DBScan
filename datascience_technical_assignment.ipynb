    "Please complete the assignment inside this notebook. Make sure the code can be executed easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write production-ready code using OOP when relevant.\n",
    "- For question 1, create simple unit tests for your code where applicable.\n",
    "- For question 1, add comments and documentation strings for all methods. \n",
    "- For question 2 and 3, discuss your design choices.\n",
    "- For question 2 and 3, discuss the complexity (Big O notation) of your solutions, both memory wise and performance wise.\n",
    "- For question3, provide map visualization when relevant\n",
    "- Try to stick to the most popular scientific Python libraries."
